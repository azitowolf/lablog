        <h1>Emphasize Written Content Using the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> Element</h1>
<h2>Semantic HTML Basics</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/semantic-html/emphasize-text-and-change-meaning-with-the-em-element-eace4d061440">View this post on Medium</a></strong></p>
<p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element marks text that is emphasized relative to it's surrounding text, most commonly the contents of a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. In english, there is a lot of semantic meaning contained in what you decide to emphasize, so this tag can substantially change the meaning of the content on your page. Take the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Plants&lt;/em&gt; use photosynthesis, while animals have to eat to generate energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The em tag here tells us that plants plants are the focus of this paragraph, not animals.</p>
<h2>Why the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>element is importatnt</h2>
<p>Take the sentence &quot;She isn't flying to hawaii tomorrow&quot;.</p>
<p>If you emphasize &quot;She&quot;, then the sentence implies (means) that she isn't flying, but other people likely are flying to hawaii tomorrow</p>
<p>If you emphasize the word &quot;hawaii&quot; then the sentence immplies that she is flying to a location other than Hawaii (France, perhaps)</p>
<p>The same concept applies to textual information on our webpages, which is why the em tag is important to include in sections of text.</p>
<h2>Em Element Categories</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element is considered to be &quot;phrasing&quot; content, defined as &quot;the text of the document&quot; and can be used anywhere in the document body where phrasing content is expected. It is most commonly, but not always found as a child of a paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag).</p>
