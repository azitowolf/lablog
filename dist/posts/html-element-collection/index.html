        <h1>WTF is an HTMLElementCollection?</h1>
<h2>And why does it matter</h2>
<p>Have you ever written the following code?</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const paragraphsToHide = document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;p.hide&quot;);
paragraphsToHide.forEach(para =&gt; para.hidden = true);
// error = paragraphsToHide.forEach is not a function!!!

</code></pre>
<h2>What is an HTMLCollection?</h2>
<p>An HTMLCollection  is a grouping of HTML Elements, commonly used in manipulating groups of elements on a page.</p>
<p>Maybe you're trying to loop through a list of paragraphs on the page, maybe trying to consolidate form inputs or hide all non-selected navigation elements. There are many cases where you might want to perform this type of iteration.</p>
<p>The reason that I use the term &quot;grouping&quot; instead of &quot;array&quot; is because although the HTMLCol;lection is &quot;iteratable&quot;, it is not actually an array.</p>
<h2>How do I use an HTMLcollection?</h2>
<p>There are a couple ways to use the HTMLCollection. The first is to use a for...of loop. This looks similar to a for loop, but it has a slightly more compact and easy to use syntax.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll();
for (let para of paragraphs) {
    console.log(para.innerTextContent);
}
// returns the list of HTMLElements

</code></pre>
<p>The second is to use a classic for loop. This is a very familiar syntax and is thought to be the most performant of any of the methods. If you do have performance concerns for your application this would be recommended.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll();
for (let i = 0; i&lt; paragraphs.length; i++) {
    const para = paragraphs[i];
    console.log(para.innerTextContent);
}
// returns the list of HTMLElements

</code></pre>
<p>The final approach is to</p>
