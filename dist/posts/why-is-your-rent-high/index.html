        <h1>Why Your Rent is So Damn High</h1>
<h1>It's because corporations don't care about you</h1>
<p>Lately, everyone I know is talking about their rent.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m sure that everyone has been bitching about their rent since the beginning of modern life, but this time it is different. National rent climbed above 2,000 dollars on average for the first time in US history https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2022/6/15/23169909/housing-market-rent-prices-national-median-over-2000-expensive-demand-redfin last July. Asking rents in the second quarter of 2022 were 23% higher nationwide compared to the same period in 2019, according to Census data released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Even more scary is that this rent explosion is damaging society in some very obvious ways. A pew research poll found that 52% of US adults are now living with their parents https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/04/a-majority-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-live-with-their-parents-for-the-first-time-since-the-great-depression/. This number has fallen since its peak during the pandemic, but has been increasing steadily from 29% in 1960 to its current 45-50% rate today. That's a big issue, because when young people can't leave their parents home, they can't innovate and improve society for the rest of us.</p>
<h1>Why is rent so high?</h1>
<p>Here is where things get really interesting. Everyone has a hot take on the reason even john Oliver did a Special https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4qmDnYli2E on the topic.</p>
<p>Many people blame inflation, but that position misses the mark. First rent has been increasing proportionaltely faster than inflation for a long time now, so even if it was partially responsible, it would only explain a small portion of the increase. Inflation rose up to 30% year over year in 2022, meaning that 20% of the encrease should be dure to other factors.</p>
<p>Many people blame real estate speculators, which is at least partially true. Wealth inequality means that those with money have more of it, and are more than willing to use that money to buy homes as investments rather than as residences, or to have more than one home just for the sake of luxury.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the real answer is this: Commodification of Real Estate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With each passing year in the United States, less and less Humans are buying single family homes. In the last quarter of 2021, only 80% of homes https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-q4-2021/ were purchased by humans. Who is buying the other 20%, you might ask? The answer is institutional investors, who have decided to turn housing into the next publically traded asset.</p>
<p>Take a look at this company, DiveryFund https://diversyfund.com/. Their business model is as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>purchase homes or home communities</li>
<li>rent them out and collect the money</li>
<li>sell partial ownership of these homes as financial assets to investors, guaranteeing a 5-10% return.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many similar companies around the world doing the same thing, commoditizing the homes of actual people to create a digital asset that can pay back investors. These companies are often called REITs, or Real Estate Investment Trusts, and together they are perpetrating the largest theft of waelth from the middle class to the upper class that has happened in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>The problem with REITs is that they have an obligation to return as much money as possible to investors. That means that if they can raise rent 15% in a year, they will. If they can raise it 20, even better. There is no limit because a &quot;Trust&quot; has no obligations other than to make money. That means that they will cater to the high end of renters, usually funding luxury apartments or townhouse construction.</p>
<p>For an additional look into the world of REITs, I recommend listening to this podcast. It explain in shocking detail the way that real estate investment companies swooped in after the 2008 houing crisis, bought a lot of homes, and then rented them back to the same people that were just evicted.</p>
<p>https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ee02OyjF2Y3muNgho2WCJ?si=1f2e9ac75b7a4ca9</p>
<p>So let's take a step back and think - what is the effect of the real estate market losing 20% of its housing stock to institutional investors? With less supply comes mroe demand and higher rent prices. What is the effect of predatory companies pushing rents to the absolute limit of people's willingness to pay? Also higher rent prices.</p>
<p>The trend of institutional investing in residential real estate is the biggest contributor to the housing afforbability crisis, and will be a major political in the years to come.</p>
<p>Who is to Blame?</p>
<p>The answer is really twofold, and will probably surprise you.</p>
<p>The first answer is obviously regulators. There shoudl be no such thing as a REIT. It is dangerous to allow the financial industry to play with something as vital as housing, and it MUSt be the governments job to protect people from predatory behavior like this.</p>
<p>The second answer is - you. The average person is to blame, because many average people like me or you are invested in these types of assets, sometimes without even knowing it. In an ironic twist of fate, REITs actually hav e convinced people to buy into a scheme that is destroying other people's livelyhoods.</p>
