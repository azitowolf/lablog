# tinycode

Hi, I'm [Alex Zito](https://medium.com/@tinycode), a web developer and blogger with more than 10 years experience in the industry.

My goal is to help software developers become proficient with the most basic and fundamental Web Technology, HTML. Too many web developers make it too far into their careers without becoming competent HTML authors, and I'd like to change that. 

If this is your first time here, I suggest reading "[How to Read the HTML Specification](/posts/html-how-to-read-the-spec/)" and then [give it a shot](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) yourself. Then you can view some of the individual posts about specific elements, or you can take a look at the [cheat sheets](/posts/cheat-sheets) that I've been working on to help people master HTML.
