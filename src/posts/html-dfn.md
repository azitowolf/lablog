The HTML <dfn> element is a text element that’s used to indicate a definition (a word and then its meaning) in your text content.


Generally speaking, the text in the <dfn> tag is the text that’s being defined. However, if you want to use a modified version of the defined text instead of the definition itself, the <abbr> element’s title attribute can be substituted as the text to be defined.

For example:


As with all of the text semantics elements, the dfn element is rendered inline and expect only text (or an abbr element) as a child.
