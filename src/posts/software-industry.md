Are you a software developer in 2020? It's time to Specialize.

The software industry is in decline. The last 30 years from the dot com boom to now have produced a huge wave of innovation across so many sectors, leaving healthcare, shopping, food, communications along with countless others completely transformed. 

For example, in 1990 you would drive your car to a grocery store and buy your food, once a week. In 2022, you connect to the internet and hail a driver plus a shopper to do the task for you and deliver your groceries directly to your door. In 1990, you would dial a friend on their home phone, and if they had gone out for a walk you would miss them. In 2022 you can instantly communicate with them for free at the touch of a button, from anywhere around the world. 

These types of changes have been massive, and have opened many doors to increased quality of life and productivity, but the incremental innovations are starting to wane, and in many fields there is a ceiling on what more innovation can happen through software.  

Take communications, for example. The leap from the 1990s to now has been astronomical, but now in a world that has near-instant video communication available to anyone with a decent wifi connection, what is the next big leap going to be? The meta-verse? Neural-link? Olfactory communication? Not only are the low-hanging innovations in the communications field few and far between, but they are also not acheivable with only software. There is at least a hardware component, and potentially even a biological that will be involved in the next innovation leap in this space. 

This "software ceiling" is echoed across many, many industries. The big unlock of the internet and internet protocols made software extremely powerful from the 1990s until now, but now we are seeing the end of software innovation. Companies that try to innovate by adding buzzwords like "blockchain" or "machine-learning" to their products already see the writing on the wall. The efficiency added to most industries through ML are small, and at the end of the day will likely end up reducing the need for software professionals not increasing them.

SDoftware companies are starting to lay off their engineers. This is because there simply isn't enough innovation coming from "software-only" companies to support their hiring growth. Take Wayfair - wayfair brands themselves as a "software company" but they haven't come up with any real software innovation since their founding in 2017 in the last 3 years they've had to lay off 30% of their workforce. I would expect to see many more of these types of layoffs in industries where software innovation is the main product.

Another factor playing into this trend is that the very nature of software means that programmers remove the need for their own jobs. take cloud computing, for example. There used to be a need for software and hardware specialists who understood how to build and maintain server farms. This was a high skilled and high paying job that led to innovation. Sadly, the innovation was a centralized service, called cloud computing, which now allows lower-skilled employees to manage entire applications infrastructure.

    

The Silver Lining

There are some fields within software that are still growing - cybersecurity, cloud computing + devops, programatic biology, data science and machine learning, and blockchain technology. These feilds will continue to develop, but these are specialized fields within software industry that are not going to be able to keep every generalist developer employed. 

Are you a generalist developer? It might be time to get yourself a certificate or degree in a specialized field, or otherwise make sure that you are at the top of your game as a generalist, because the next 10 years are going to

Where is the next round of hyper-innovation going to happen? Is it in materials science? In water managment? In healthcare? It's hard to predict where the next big "unlock" is going to happen that will open the doors to new innovation, but my guess is that it will be in Synthetic Biology and Chemistry, where new breakthroughs are allowing scientists to "program" cells to perform specialized tasks.
